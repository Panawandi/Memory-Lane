Memory Lane is a personal project created for me and my close friends.
It is a digital platform where we can register users, log in, and watch videos together.
We can add comments under each video to share our thoughts and memories.
The project is built with .NET and SQL Server Management Studio, and it focuses on privacy and security while contributing to strengthening our friendships through shared memories.

Features
User registration and authentication
Video playback and sharing
Comments (Coming Soon!): Users will soon be able to comment on videos to share their thoughts and memories with each other.
Memory Lane is not yet public(Soon to be!).
